NodeJS app for Angello sample in AngularJS in action book.

## Running it

First, you need to set the `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` and `MONGO_URL` enviroment variables. For that, you can just create a `.env` file with those variables (similar to the `.env.development` file).

After that, just run `npm install` and `node server.js` and you're good to go :).
